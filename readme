Notes: This is a sample python program that I wrote to demonstrate Object Oriented (OO) concepts that is capable of playing simple card games.  To play the simple game, run one of the programs under the package CardGames.

The programs use classes I created for Cards, Decks of Cards and Players to deal cards to players and then make an asessment about who won.

To play the game, run any of the files in the directory "Card Games"

My favorite classes are under the directory "Cards"
	- CardDeck.py - creates a collection of 52 Card Objects, along with shuffle methods, etc
	- Card.py - stores information about a single card, as well as custom comparsion operation __gt__(self, compare_to) that enables simple comparisons
